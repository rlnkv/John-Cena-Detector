Recently, I discovered that a lot of people suffer from a rare disease: they just DON’T SEE JOHN CENA!

Even though he’s a big muscular guy and a talented actor, their brains simply refuse to acknowledge his presence (even when he wears white pants).

I call this disease CENABLINDNESS.

I feel bad for people with this rare and unpleasant condition. Imagine their struggle watching Peacemaker—just an empty spot talking about feelings and his childish perception of the world. Horrible!

Cenablindness is also very stressful for drivers. Imagine the anxiety, knowing that at any second on the road you could accidentally hit a jaywalking John. A true nightmare!

So, I decided to help those poor souls.

I invented the Cena Detector.

And remember: stop calling me a hero or using other pleasant words like “sexy.” I’m not doing this for gratitude — I just want to make the world a better place.

PS: It's just a fun project I made while learning basics of Machine Learning. Half of it was vibe coded, but I truly understand what line do what.
So it:
- Trains a ResNet18 model to distinguish John Cena images.  
- Includes an interactive Gradio app to upload an image and check if Cena is present.  
- Built and trained in Kaggle.
